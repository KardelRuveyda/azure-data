# Azure Data Handbook 📘

This digital space is the central hub for my learning journey and technical expertise in the Azure data world.

As a **Digital Cloud Solution Architect**, I bring together everything I learn while exploring how data is processed, stored, and managed in the Azure ecosystem. For me, this is not just documentation; it is a "living notebook" where I crystallize architectural challenges, solutions, and technical details.

## 🚀 This is My Learning Space

My main motivation for creating this handbook is to make complex Azure data services more understandable and applicable. I share everything I have worked on, experienced, and learned about the Azure-Data ecosystem—from core concepts to the most complex cloud architectures—step by step.

## 🛠️ How to Use It?

I have organized my notes to be practical and strategic from an architect's perspective:

* **Systematic Progress:** You can start from basic concepts and move toward deep technical topics using the menu on the left.
* **Quick Access:** The search bar at the top will be your best friend when you are looking for a specific topic or service.
* **Bilingual Structure:** I also design some of my notes in English to meet global standards; you can change the language at the top right.

These notes will continue to update and grow as I learn and experience new projects. Let's dive into the Azure data ocean!
